1 - Write a script that prompt the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of a triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).

Enter base: 20
Enter height: 10
The area of the triangle is 50

2 - Write a script that prompt the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle and and calculate the perimeter of triangle (perimeter = a + b + c)

Enter side a: 5
Enter side b: 4
Enter side c: 3
The perimeter of the triangle is 12

3 - Get length and width using prompt and calculate an area of rectangle (area = length x width and the perimeter of rectangle (perimeter = 2 x (length + width))

4 - Get radius using prompt and calculate the area of a circle (area = pi x r x r) and circumference of a circle(c = 2 x pi x r) where pi = 3.14.

5 - Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2

6 - Slope is (m = y2-y1/x2-x1). Find the slope between point (2, 2) and point(6,10)

7 - Compare the slope of above two questions.

8 - Calculate the value of y (y = x^2 + 6x + 9). Try to use different x values and figure out at what x value y is 0.

9 - Writ a script that prompt a user to enter hours and rate per hour. Calculate pay of the person?

Enter hours: 40
Enter rate per hour: 28
